## Cardiac Arrhythmia: Feature Selection

#### Overview

In this miniature project, I explored the classification of cardiac arrhythmia
over the influence of 279 different factors. The data, pulled from the [UCI
Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia),
contained 16 different classifications and 452 individual records.

This report will provide a walkthrough of the feature and model selection
process from data import to final selection.

#### Data Import

The data was first imported from a .csv from the [UCI Machine Learning
Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/arrhythmia/arrhythmia.data).
